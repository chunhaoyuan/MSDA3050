# Publicly available datasets 

## Dataset example:

- Link: [Google Dataset](https://www.google.com)

- Purpose (what would you use this dataset for, explain, a short paragraph): 
I would use this "dataset" (not really a dataset) to search for more details of extratestrial life. 

## Dataset 1:

- Link: [Wine quality](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)
- Purpose (what would you use this dataset for, explain, a short paragraph): Now that people’s quality of life is improving, food and wine are becoming more and more common, but not everyone has research on red wine. It is not easy for an ordinary person to choose a bottle of red wine that meets everyone’s expectations. The challenge is that you don’t want the quality of the wine you choose to be bad. Next, if a bottle of bad quality wine is bid up by the merchant, then people will be deceived on the price. If we can see through the data The provided acidity, density, PH value or other factors that affect the quality of red wine can be used to train the machine. Then we can use the results to classify red wine in the future, so that people do not have to worry about buying bad quality products when buying.

## Dataset 2:

- Link: [Stock price prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse)
- Purpose (what would you use this dataset for, explain, a short paragraph): We all know that in addition to active income, we also need passive income, and stocks are a kind of passive income. However, we all know that the stock market will continue to change with the daily situation, and how do we ensure that the stocks we buy It is stable enough, or can guarantee the maximum benefit in the future, this is something we have always wanted to know. We don’t want to buy a certain company’s stock, and the company’s operating problems lead to the company’s bankruptcy, so the stock we bought will become waste paper. Therefore, choosing this data for machine learning allows us to make judgments based on this data. With stock prices, you can buy at a low price at the right time, and you can use the data to determine which company is most likely to go bankrupt, and then you must open a high-risk portfolio.

## Dataset 3:

- Link: [Fake news detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)
- Purpose (what would you use this dataset for, explain, a short paragraph): In today's society, fraud is a simple matter. People sometimes leave false comments on something because they see fake news, and the fact of fake news sometimes appears in politics, sometimes In order to discredit the opponent, fake news about the opponent is created to confuse the public and make the public lose confidence in the person. However, using machine learning, we can use data to judge the credibility of these articles and reduce the occurrence of errors. 

## Dataset 4:

- Link: [Credit card approval prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction)
- Purpose (what would you use this dataset for, explain, a short paragraph): Credit card can be said to be something that everyone must go out. Although everyone has this thing, with the emergence of card debt, credit bankruptcy and other problems, not everyone can easily get a credit card. Because the bank will judge the credibility of this person based on specific data and decide whether to issue a credit card. Therefore, by establishing the ML model, we can use these data to determine whether the applicant is eligible for a credit card, so as to reduce the bank's own losses.

## Dataset 5:

- Link: [Parkinson disease detection](https://www.kaggle.com/debasisdotcom/parkinson-disease-detection)
- Purpose (what would you use this dataset for, explain, a short paragraph): Parkinson's disease is an increasingly common disease in today's society. Use these data to establish an ML model to determine whether there is a potential risk of getting sick.

# Dataset information


## Chosen dataset: ***dataset1***


```python
import pandas
```


```python
# You will now proceed with a serious of commands in the next cell(s) that demonstrate some level of manipulation of the dataset that you are interested, in my case dataset1

# As you enter and execute commands leave the outputs so that I can read the manipulation that you did. Use all of your python skills here that you wish

# As an example I am providing some commands that have absolutly nothing to do with a dataset but just to illustrate the capture in my Jupyter notebook

# Once done, you can save this Jupyter notebook as a markdown and this is what I want you to commit to your private repo. Once you have your assignment ready, invite me to your private repo
```


```python
list1 = range(1,11)
```


```python
for member in list1:
    print(f'{member}) Are we having fun yet? YES!')
```

    1) Are we having fun yet? YES!
    2) Are we having fun yet? YES!
    3) Are we having fun yet? YES!
    4) Are we having fun yet? YES!
    5) Are we having fun yet? YES!
    6) Are we having fun yet? YES!
    7) Are we having fun yet? YES!
    8) Are we having fun yet? YES!
    9) Are we having fun yet? YES!
